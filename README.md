# Hubot Skype Adapter

## Description

This is the [Skype](http://skype.com) adapter for
[hubot](http://hubot.github.com) that allows you to communicate with hubot
through Skype.

## Installation

* Add `hubot-skype` as a dependency in your hubot's `package.json` (use this repository url `git://github.com/netpro2k/hubot-skype.git` as the version)
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Install Python dependency `Skype4py` with `pip` or `easy_install`
* Log into a Skype client on the same machine you are running hubot
* Run hubot with `bin/hubot -a skype`

## Usage

The Skype adapter works by communicating through a locally running Skype
client. You need to create a Skype account for your bot, and log into it
on a Skype client running on the same machine as hubot. When you first
launch hubot with the Skype adapter, Skype will prompt you to allow for
API permission. You must allow this before the bot will work.

## OS Specific notes

### OSX

The current version of Skype4Py doesn't play nicely with the 64 bit version
of python on OSX and would immediately cause a segmentation fault, but a
workaround has been established in this repo using the `arch` command (see
`/src/python32bit` for details).

If this built in workaround doesn't seem to work, you may need to force python
to run in 32 bit mode by setting the environment variable 
`VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT` to `true`

Ex:

```bash
export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes
./hubot -a skype
```

### Linux
If you would like to use a different transport type than the default (`x11`) 
you may set the `HUBOT_SKYPE_TRANSPORT` environment variable. Currently 
supported values are `x11` amd `dbus`. More information on
[module page](http://skype4py.sourceforge.net/doc/html/Skype4Py.api.posix-module.html).
